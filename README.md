# IPL-Data
A dynamic IPL data analysis dashboard has been made in power bi extracting the data from the SQL server & after uploading those data set “One to Many” relationship has been established keeping "Id" as a primary key. Few typing error has been corrected through power query editor. 
By using DAX query few important measures have been calculated like Title winner, Batter runs, Bowler wickets, Economy rate, Average, bowling SR & Matches win on toss decision. 
One slicer has been used on top of the dashboard on year (2008-2022) to make the entire dashboard dynamic. 
In KPIs we found Title Winner, Orange Cap, Purple Cap, and Tournament Sixes & Tournament Fours. Individual IPL Batting Status has been introduced with total runs, sum of 6’s & 4’s & strike rate with slicer similarly individual IPL Bowling Status was shown with total wickets, economy rate, average & bowling SR with slicer. 
Bar chart has been used to denote the no of matches won by venue & total no of winning matches by each team for a season. 
Through pie chart matches won based on toss is described & donut char is used for matches won by result type like wickets, runs, super over & no result.
